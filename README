Some bash scripts that I use:

- dualscreen: script to enable dual using xrandr (for window managers that
  do not have a way to do that via a GUI).
- touchscreen: script to start florence (on screen keyboard) or kills all
  running processes of it. Sets keyboard layout to German as well.
- mench264: Transcode video to H.264 with mencoder in 3 passes.
- mencjpeg: Encode a series of jpeg pictures to an MJPEG movie with mencoder. 
  Useful for exported frames from an animation application like Blender.
- mencmjpeg: Transcode video to MJPEG with mencoder using the nosound option 
  for usage with Pd/GEM, expecially Denno Senshi Porygon, for the reasoning
  see http://www.mail-archive.com/pd-list@iem.at/msg37332.html.
- mencxvid: Transcode video to XVID with mencoder in 2 passes.
- mknoise and stopnoise: Starts and stops jackd, qjackctl and audio programs
  in one command. Takes text files as input for the additional audio programs,
  each program on a seperate line including command line arguments for startup,
  cf. mknoise-sample.
